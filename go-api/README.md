# GO API

Warlok currently uses Firebase for hosting and data storage.

This is great for building something quick and getting users signed up easily.

However, more dynamic functionality would be better implemented with an independent API hosted on Google Cloud.

Ultimately the goal will be to interface with Twitch, YouTube, Twitter, and Google Analytics to provide better analytics when building a schedule.

MongoDB will likely be the database of choice this backend.
