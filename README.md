# Warlok (Smart) Stream Scheduler

## Project Description
Currently no so 'smart' this scheduler built with VueJS is a starting point for a larger project.
Eventually I would like to integrate this into the larger Warlok project.
Before that happens I need to decide whether to stick with VueJS or NextJS with React.

so far Vue is winning.

I need to migrate the backend from Firebase to Go on Google Cloud with MongoDB

Then it will be important to integrate with the Twitch, YouTube, and IGDB apis.
